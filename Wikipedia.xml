'''Creme Puff''' (August 3, 1967 &amp;ndash; August 6, 2005) was a [[cat|domestic cat]], owned by Jake Perry of [[Austin, Texas]], US. She was [[List of oldest cats|the oldest cat ever recorded]], according to the 2010 edition of ''[[Guinness World Records]]'',&lt;ref name=G2010&gt;{{cite book |year=2010 |title=Guinness World Records 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLYzvUvPL3MC&amp;pg=PA320 |publisher=Bantam; Reprint edition |page=320 |isbn=978-0-553-59337-2 |quote=The oldest cat ever was Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until April 1, 1998—36 years and 3 days in total. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oldest cat ever |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-cat-ever |publisher=Guinness World Records Corporate |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warren |first=Jessica |date=October 23, 2009 |title=Caterack Dies - World's Oldest Cat Was 30! |url=http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=42&amp;num=28649 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909030904/http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=42&amp;num=28649 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 9, 2012 |quote=A report from MSNBC News notes that the oldest cat ever recorded was a 36-year-old feline named Creme Puff, according to a rep from Guinness World Records. |work=The National Ledger |accessdate=July 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when she died aged 38 years and 3 days.

Perry had another cat, Granpa Rex Allen, who he said was born in [[Paris, Texas]], on 1 February 1964 and died aged 34 years and 59 days on 1 April 1998. The sixth oldest cat ever known, Granpa was posthumously awarded 1999 Cat of the Year by ''Cats &amp; Kittens'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226035922/http://www.petpublishing.com/catkit/articles/grandpa.shtml |archivedate=February 26, 2010 |url=http://www.petpublishing.com/catkit/articles/grandpa.shtml |title=Grandpa Rexs Allen - Cats &amp; Kittens 1999 Cat of the Year |work=Cats &amp; Kittens Magazine |accessdate=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured in an earlier version of the ''Guinness World Records'' as the (then) oldest cat ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oldest cat ever |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-cat-ever |website=Guinness World Records |publisher=guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=January 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifestyle ==
Creme Puff's owner, Jake Perry, said her diet consisted of dry cat food supplemented with broccoli, eggs, turkey bacon, coffee with cream, and—every two days—"an eyedropper full of red wine". Perry claimed that this diet was key to her longevity, and that the wine "circulated the arteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-raise-a-165-year-old-cat|title=How to Raise a 165-Year-Old Cat|last=Couch|first=Christina|date=December 19, 2015|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=December 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perry also kept Creme Puff very active within the home, turning his garage into a movie theater that played nature documentaries for his cats. Wooden steps were built into the walls of Perry's home for the cats to climb on, and Perry had built a screened enclosure in his backyard for his pets, including Creme Puff, to enjoy the outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leclair|first=Britanie|date=January 23, 2018|title=Owners Of World's Oldest Cats Reveal Secrets of Feline Longevity.

'''Tuxedo Stan''' ({{circa}} 2010 – September 9, 2013) was a black and white cat who ran for mayor of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] in the 2012 municipal elections. After the announcement of his candidacy, he achieved international attention and was endorsed by [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Anderson Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ellen-degeneres-endorses-tuxedo-stan-for-mayor-1.1242385 |title=Ellen Degeneres endorses Tuxedo Stan for mayor |website=cbc.ca |date=October 16, 2012 |access-date=June 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political campaign==
In 2012, a small group of friends created a political party ("The Tuxedo Party of Canada") to raise awareness of the growing feral cat population in Halifax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tuxedostan.com/ |title=Tuxedo Party of Canada |access-date=June 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; They created a [[Facebook]] group and announced Tuxedo Stan's candidacy for mayor of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] in the 2012 municipal elections. Although he was unable to formally run because regulations required that candidates have a [[birth certificate]],&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/tuxedo-stan-the-halifax-cat-who-ran-for-mayor-dies-1.1700782 |title=Tuxedo Stan, the Halifax cat who ran for mayor, dies |website=cbc.ca |date=September 9, 2013 |access-date=June 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; he quickly gained international attention and drew attention to local [[Trap–neuter–return]] efforts.

In the wake of his failed mayoral bid, the [[Halifax Regional Council]] voted to give $40,000 to the SPCA for a new vet clinic that will spay and neuter feral cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/halifax-city-council-approves-40-000-for-feral-cat-clinic-1.1281547 |title=Halifax city council approves $40,000 for feral cat clinic |website=ctvnews.ca |date=May 14, 2013 |access-date=June 30, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Tuxedo Stan was euthanized by his owners on September 9, 2013 after a battle with terminal cancer.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt;

'''Think Think''' ({{zh|c=想想|p=Xiǎngxiǎng}}) and '''Ah Tsai''' ({{zh|c=阿才|p=Ācái|labels=no}}) are two cats belonging to the [[President of Taiwan]], [[Tsai Ing-wen]]. Think Think is a female grey [[tabby cat|tabby]], while Ah Tsai is ginger, and male.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/989665/taiwans-cat-loving-president-to-adopt-retired-guide-dogs |title=Taiwan's cat-loving president to adopt retired guide dogs |newspaper=[[Bangkok Post]] |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nikkei1"/&gt;

Posting a picture of herself with one of the cats, she said: "...we can exercise our sense of humor...but we can’t make jokes about the pandemic, to avoid breaking the law", and: "I wish everybody not only a humorous, but also healthy and safe April Fools’ Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Submission|first=Internal|date=2020-04-01|title=Pandemic pranks off the table on April Fools' Day|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/01/world/pandemic-pranks-off-table-april-fools-day/|access-date=2020-07-09|website=The Japan Times|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Tsai posted pictures on social media of Ah Tsai attentively watching television, and enjoying the Animal Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=三立新聞網|date=2019-02-07|title=「蔡阿才」看電視遭蔡英文偷拍！不科學身材引網友熱議 {{!}} 政治 {{!}} 三立新聞網 SETN.COM|url=https://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=496078|access-date=2020-07-13|website=www.setn.com|language=zh-Hant-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Valentine's Day in 2019, Tsai's message to citizens featured the two cats.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; In the lead up to the 2020 election, Tsai advised her supporters to ignore 'fake news' about the cats' health, and that they were in fine form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=蔡英文秀貓活蹦亂跳 稱不要在網路造謠|url=https://www.ctwant.com/article/10420|access-date=2020-07-13|website=www.ctwant.com|language=zh-Hant-TW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2020, Tsai visited the [[Hsinchu]] Animal Protection Education Park, where she made a statement urging citizens who wanted pets to adopt stray animals, instead of purchasing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=參訪新竹市動保園區 總統呼籲國人「以認養代替購買」 讓無家可歸的毛小孩重新開始新的生活|url=https://www.president.gov.tw/NEWS/25441|access-date=2020-07-24|website=www.president.gov.tw|language=zh-tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
===Supporters and critics===
Shortly after Tsai was elected as president in 2016, she was criticised for being a single woman – and therefore 'emotional' and 'erratic' – in a newspaper article published by China's state news agency [[Xinhua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/world/asia/china-taiwan-tsai-unmarried-single.html |title=Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's First Female Leader, Is Assailed in China for Being 'Emotional' |first1=Javier C. |last1=Hernández |first2=Vanessa Piao |last2=May |date=25 May 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article, written by [[Wang Weixing]]&lt;ref name="straitstimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/sexist-remarks-on-tsai-ing-wen-spark-outrage-in-china-taiwan |title=Sexist remarks on Tsai Ing-wen spark outrage in China, Taiwan |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a military officer in the [[Peoples Liberation Army|PLA]], provoked an outcry for its sexist views,&lt;ref name="straitstimes1"/&gt; and was quickly withdrawn. On China's social media platform [[Sina Weibo]], one commentator suggested that the Chinese leadership are "... probably threatened that a cat lady like Ms Tsai could beat any men she sets her mind to&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/05/25/taiwan-president-accused-of-being-extremist-and-erratic-because-she-is-single/ |title=Taiwan president accused of being "extremist" and "erratic" because she is single |author=WITW Staff |website=[[Women in the World]] |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese activist magazine ''New Bloom'' describes her as 'an unorthodox politician&amp;nbsp;... a female academic who loves cats and supports [[LGBT rights in Taiwan|gay rights]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newbloommag.net/2016/01/18/taiwan-narrative-tsai/ |title=Is the Narrative About Taiwan Changing After Tsai Ing-Wen's Presidential Victory? |first=Brian |last=Hioe |website=New Bloom |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gideon Rachman of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' observes that Tsai is one of two cat-lovers who have recently risen to power – the other being [[Jaroslaw Kaczynski]], leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://next.ft.com/content/165b3e09-847e-3e05-930e-33ea5802b7b6 |title=Rise of the cat leaders |first=Gideon |last=Rachman |newspaper=Financial Times |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=20 June 2016 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, while in Miami, Tsai met Taiwanese professional baseball pitcher [[Wei-Yin Chen]], whose gifts to her included feeding bowls for each of the two cats and three adopted dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201606260009.aspx |title=U.S. representative welcomes Tsai in Miami, voices support for Taiwan |first1=Tony |last1=Liao |first2=Sophia |last2=Yeh |first3=Elizabeth |last3=Hsu |website=Focus Taiwan |publisher=Central News Agency |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three dogs – Bella, Bunny and Maru===

After first being sworn in as president, Tsai also announced plans to adopt three retired [[guide dog]]s once she moves into her [[Official Residence of the President of the Republic of China|official residence]].&lt;ref name="straitstimes2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-cat-loving-president-tsai-ing-wen-to-adopt-3-retired-guide-dogs |title=Taiwan's cat-loving President Tsai Ing-wen to adopt 3 retired guide dogs |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=26 May 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media in Taiwan asked Tsai whether she anticipated any conflict with her cats, but she said that the dogs "are very well trained and they can definitely get along with the cats".&lt;ref name="straitstimes2"/&gt;

Other observers attempted to draw parallels with Taiwan's political situation. Alex Lo, writing in Hong Kong's ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', has suggested that Tsai's adoption of the dogs is a good sign for relations between Taiwan and [[Mainland China]].&lt;ref name="SCMP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1956856/tale-cats-dogs-and-cross-strait-relations |title=A tale of cats, dogs and cross-strait relations |first=Alex |last=Lo |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=27 May 2016 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that the Taiwanese are 'cat people', while the mainland Chinese are 'dog people' – citing a psychological study indicating cat lovers are 11 per cent more open to 'unusual ideas', while dog people are more 'conventional and traditional'.&lt;ref name="SCMP2"/&gt; In Singapore, ''[[The Straits Times]]'' dismissed as media speculation any suggestion of a 'civil war' between Tsai's cats and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-cat-loving-president-to-adopt-dogs-too |title=Taiwan's cat-loving President to adopt dogs too |newspaper=The Straits Times |date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsai adopted the dogs in October 2016, and their names are Bella, Bunny and Maru. She signed their adoption papers at a ceremony organised by the Huikuang Guide Dog Foundation, where she vowed to improve the barrier-free environment for visually impaired people and their seeing-eye dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2016/11/03/2003658436 |title=President Tsai adopts three retired guide dogs 蔡英文總統 收養三隻退役導盲犬 |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2017-01-14 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three dogs, Tsai has described Bella as her favourite; while Bunny is 'elegant' and Maru is 'timid'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=獨／蔡英文形容3愛犬：Maru最膽小、Bella最愛吃、Bunny最優雅 {{!}} ETtoday新聞雲|url=https://www.ettoday.net/news/20190207/1371858.htm|access-date=2020-07-13|website=www.ettoday.net|language=zh-Hant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election campaigns==
=== 2015–2016 ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tsai Ing-wen with Think Think and Ah Tsai.jpg|thumb|right|Imagery of Think Think (left) and Ah Tsai (right) appeared in Tsai's 2016 social media and election campaigning.&lt;ref name="focustaiwan1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201510110006.aspx |title=Campaign focuses on Tsai Ing-wen's pets |first1=S.P. |last1=Yeh |first2=Lillian |last2=Lin |website=Focus Taiwan |publisher=[[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]] |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;{{Main|2016 Taiwanese presidential election}}

Think Think and Ah Tsai featured as part of Tsai's presidential campaign in 2015 and 2016,&lt;ref name="focustaiwan1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201510110006.aspx |title=Campaign focuses on Tsai Ing-wen's pets |first1=S.P. |last1=Yeh |first2=Lillian |last2=Lin |website=Focus Taiwan |publisher=[[Central News Agency (Taiwan)|Central News Agency]] |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the press sometimes referring to her as 'Cat Woman'.&lt;ref name="SCMP1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1902288/cat-woman-taiwans-first-female-president-huge-fan |title=Cat Woman: Taiwan's first female president huge fan of felines |first=Nectar |last=Gan |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign, Tsai's Facebook pages on cat-related topics received many more hits than pages discussing policy issues – with the rate of 'likes' being up to 50 percent higher.&lt;ref name="focustaiwan1" /&gt;

A page showing Ah Tsai receiving a vaccination on [[World Animal Day]] was especially popular, with nearly 30,000 'likes' (as of October 2015).&lt;ref name="focustaiwan1"/&gt; Her campaign team produced an animated film, ''Cat in a Paper Carton – Think Think''; and the feline also appeared in ''Light up Taiwan'', a book outlining Tsai's political views.&lt;ref name="focustaiwan1"/&gt;

Tsai's love of cats is well known among her supporters, and young people in particular are fans of the two cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chew |last=Hui Min |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwans-first-woman-president-10-things-you-should-know-about-tsai-ing-wen |title=Taiwan's first woman president: 10 things you should know about Tsai Ing-wen |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Chinese New Year]] video message in 2015 included a grey tabby cat  trying to break free from her arms.&lt;ref name="SCMP1"/&gt; As part of her campaign, Tsai and her cats were transformed into [[anime]] video characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/01/19/taiwans-president-elect-tsai-ing-wen-appears-as-cute-moe-anime-girl-in-awesome-campaign-videos/ |first=Oona |last=McGee |title=Taiwan's president-elect Tsai Ing-wen appears as cute moe anime girl in awesome campaign videos |website=RocketNews24 |date=19 January 2016 |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated cartoon was not in [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]], the language promoted by the ROC government for decades, but [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], a language which was once scorned by Tsai's opponents, the previously dominant [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT)]].&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21702223-taiwans-obsession-japanese-kawaii-culture-hello-kitty-goodbye-panda |title=Hello Kitty, goodbye panda |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=16 July 2016 |accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davina Tham of the ''[[Taipei Times]]'' said that Tsai personifies the nation's attitudes toward women in power.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-02-14|title=Boom, zap, pow: Tsai Ing-wen saves the day - Taipei Times|url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2019/02/14/2003709694|access-date=2020-07-26|website=www.taipeitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tham cites a comic strip created in 2016 by "Stupid Sheep" called ''Presidential Slave to Cats'', portraying a cartoon likeness of Tsai juggling presidential duties with her devotion to Think Think and Ah Tsai.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Tham also cites another cartoonist, Wei Tsung-cheng, who created ''Conquerer of the Seas'', which portrays a young girl named Ing who grows up on a patriarchal island-nation; and overthrows oppressive forces which terrorise her people.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

Celebrating Tsai's election victory, the national postal agency, [[Chunghwa Post|Chunghua Post]], created a special stamp issue. It featured people from all walks of life, along with a dog and a cat; and drew attention to issues of equality and cultural diversity in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web|last=中華郵政|date=2016-01-13|title=中華郵政全球資訊網|url=https://www.post.gov.tw/post/internet/W_stamphouse/index_en.jsp?ID=2807&amp;file_name=B332&amp;stamp_cat_standard=Commemorative%20Stamps&amp;type=2805|access-date=2020-07-09|website=中華郵政}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pixelated faces of the President and Vice President were intended to express the idea that these are individuals who embody the collective spirit and style of the nation.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Other icons represented various occupations, genders, social roles and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; It was the first ever Taiwanese stamp not to feature the national flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-04-22|title=New Stamps Celebrating Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen|url=http://www.trickytaipei.com/tsai-ing-wen-stamps/|access-date=2020-07-08|website=Tricky Taipei|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsai appeared wearing a pair of pink cat ears in a DPP campaign rally advertisement, which was posted on social media by [[Freddy Lim]], frontman of [[death metal]] band [[Chthonic (band)|Chthonic]], and also himself a politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Photo of the Day: Cat ears, cosplay, death metal featured in Taiwan campaign ad|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3854070|access-date=2020-07-09|website=Taiwan News|date=10 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lim is founder of the [[New Power Party]] (NPP), he ran as an independent after a dispute about the NPP's relationship with the ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Freddy Lim triumphs in Taipei pan-blue bastion|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3855115|access-date=2020-07-11|website=Taiwan News|date=11 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his role as an independent, Lim had been voicing his support for the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Other publicity material in the Tsai campaign included a pillow in the shape of Taiwan, and  a hot sauce which was a pun on Tsai's "Hot Taiwanese Girl" nickname.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Staff|first=T.

During the 2020 election, several other politicians associated themselves with animals, pets or [[anime]] characters – such as Lii Wen, who appeared in a video wearing a pair of wings in the shape of [[mussel]]s.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Writing for ''New Bloom'', Brian Hioe suggested at least one was following Tsai's lead; highlighting main Presidential rival [[Han Kuo-yu]], who appeared with imagery of his pet [[Shiba Inu|Shibu Inu]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Taiwan's Digital Minister in charge of Social Innovation, [[Audrey Tang]], says that politicians using internet memes and cat pictures reflects a 'coming out' of digital subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-04-13|title=The civic hacker that became Digital Minister of Taiwan: interview with Audrey Tang|url=https://digitalfuturesociety.com/interviews/the-civic-hacker-that-became-digital-minister-of-taiwan-interview-with-audrey-tang/|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Digital Future Society|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tsai was elected to her second term, she was congratulated by the Hong Kong Cat Society, a cat welfare organisation, which issued a statement describing her victory as 'a win for cats'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=【最強貓奴】貓界狂賀蔡英文成功連任 「請台灣第一貓繼續統治台灣」|url=https://hk.appledaily.com/lifestyle/20200112/EGWD257WCZT7YK4RWLDGIG24N4/|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Apple Daily 蘋果日報|language=zh-hk|archive-date=2020-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726120017/https://hk.appledaily.com/lifestyle/20200112/EGWD257WCZT7YK4RWLDGIG24N4/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Following the 1999 death of the party's founder, [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], the OMRLP held a leadership election with Alan "Howling Laud" Hope (who was then the party's chairman and deputy leader) and Catmando as the only two candidates. The vote was a tie, with Hope and Catmando each receiving 125 votes. Hope, as the party chairman, had the deciding vote, and decided that he and Catmando should serve as joint leaders.&lt;ref name=SamStall&gt;Stall, Sam (2007); ''100 Cats Who Changed Civilization: History's Most Influential Felines'', pp.69,70. Quirk Books. {{ISBN|1-59474-163-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/455323.stm Loonies choose cat as joint leader], BBC News, 24 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

During Catmando's time as joint leader, the OMRLP saw its greatest electoral performance to date, fielding 15 candidates in the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. Catmando served as joint leader until his death as a result of a traffic accident in July 2002. Hope then became the party's sole leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Sholto |last= Byrnes |title=The lunatic fringe |work=The Independent |date=6 October 2004 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-lunatic-fringe-535650.html |accessdate=26 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Catmando's death, the party proposed that there should be cat-crossings on all major roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name origins==
Catmando was originally called "'''Catman'''". His name was changed after a customer at the Golden Lion (Hope's [[public house|pub]] and [[guesthouse]] in [[Ashburton, Devon]]) asked a music question that Hope could not answer; the customer commented: "I bet Catman do [know the answer]". Consequently, he became "'''Catmando'''".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The cat later moved with Hope to the Dog and Partridge public house in [[Yateley]], Hampshire. [[Gurkha]]s, stationed nearby at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]], were intrigued by a name that sounded like the [[Nepal]]ese capital [[Kathmandu]]; subsequently the cat became the subject of a front-page feature in the ''[[Nepali Times]]''. The "Cat Mandu" spelling became common through media misinterpretation, but Hope has confirmed that "Catmando" is the correct spelling.&lt;ref name=RealSpell/&gt;

One of the OMRLP proposed laws is that no other cat shall be called "Catmando", as there can only be one.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Freya''' (born {{circa}} April 2009) is a [[tabby cat]] owned by the former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the United Kingdom [[George Osborne]] and his family.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dearden |first1=Lizzie |title=George Osborne's family cat Freya sent away from Downing Street to Kent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-s-family-cat-freya-sent-away-downing-street-kent-9849853.html |work=The Independent |access-date=13 November 2020 |date=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freya went missing from the Osbornes' house in [[Notting Hill]] when she was just a few months old, and after searching West London for her, the family assumed she had died or had become lost. In June 2012, Osborne's wife received a call telling her that Freya was alive, and the family brought her home. In September 2012, Freya shared the role of [[Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office]] with the Downing Street cat [[Larry (cat)|Larry]]. In November 2014, Freya was retired from the position to the Kent countryside.

==Career==
[[File:Tabby cat photo.jpg|thumb|left|Freya at [[10 Downing Street|Number 10]]]]
On 16 September 2012, Nigel Nelson from ''[[The People]]'' reported the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] had sacked Larry from his position as [[Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office]] and installed Freya instead.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/2012/09/16/larry-the-downing-st-cat-shunted-by-pm-for-being-a-uselss-mouse-catcher-102039-23926241/|title=Larry the Downing St cat shunted by PM for being a useless mouse catcher|last=Nelson|first=Nigel|date=16 September 2012|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|access-date=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson revealed that Cameron had become fed up with Larry's laziness.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

Cameron decided to replace Larry when he refused to move from his chair to chase a mouse on September 13.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; Nelson explained, "The final straw came on Thursday when Mr Cameron caught Larry cat-napping on his chair in his No.10 study as another mouse scurried across the room. When he tried to wake Larry to do his duty one eye opened but the moggy wouldn't budge."&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;

Cameron drafted in Freya to patrol Numbers 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street as she is a "tougher" and a "more street-wise predator."&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; Freya was reported to be the more dominant cat over Larry and a more effective mouser, reportedly because her days as a stray had "hardened" her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parkinson|first=Justin|title=Downing Street denies Cameron and Osborne cat feud|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19967916|access-date=16 October 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freya has become one of 100,000 cats employed by the Government to keep the number of mice down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/9324776/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-cats.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612063302/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/qi/9324776/QI-Quite-interesting-facts-about-cats.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2012|title=QI: Quite interesting facts about cats|first=Molly|last=Oldfield|author2=Mitchinson, John|date=11 June 2012|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 2012, police had to break up a fight between Larry and Freya outside Number 10. Rosa Prince from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that Freya "appeared to have the best of the confrontation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rosa Prince|title=Police called to break up violent cat fight in Downing Street|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9611897/Police-called-to-break-up-violent-cat-fight-in-Downing-Street.html|access-date=1 November 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s spokeswoman stated that Freya and Larry were able to "co-exist" and added that she would not comment further on the two cats' adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19967916|title=Downing Street denies Cameron and Osborne cat feud|last=Parkinson|first=Justin|date=16 October 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Freya strayed over a mile from Downing Street and had to be rescued and returned by a charity worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27601264|title=George Osborne's cat rescued by homelessness worker|work=BBC News|date=28 May 2014 |access-date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Freya was hit by a car in Whitehall and was subsequently treated by a vet. George Osborne said he was "very grateful" to those who came to the aid of his pet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28710522|title=Chancellor George Osborne's cat Freya hit by car|work=BBC News|date=8 August 2014 |access-date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following these events, Freya was sent to the Kent countryside to allow her to exercise her desire to roam.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

'''Gladstone''' is a British cat who is the resident chief [[wiktionary:mouser|mouser]] to [[HM Treasury]] in [[Whitehall]], [[London]]. He is a [[domestic short-haired cat]], who, at eighteen months old, assumed the position of chief mouser in late June 2016. Gladstone's political namesake is former Chancellor and Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who served for four separate periods, more than any other Chancellor. Gladstone is responsible for catching mice at the Treasury's 1 [[Horse Guards Road]] building.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36924449|title=Gladstone the cat lands Treasury job|work=BBC News|date=29 July 2016|access-date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inception of the position of chief mouser at the Treasury followed the creation of similar positions at [[10 Downing Street]] (Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office) and the [[Foreign Office]]; those positions were held by [[Larry (cat)|Larry]] and [[Palmerston (cat)|Palmerston]], as of July 2016. The decision to introduce an official mouser was taken by [[John Kingman (businessman)|John Kingman]], former acting Permanent Secretary at the Treasury. The appointment of Gladstone as "Chief Mouser to the Treasury" was officially announced on 29 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-07-29/meet-gladstone-the-new-treasury-cat/|title=Gladstone named Treasury's chief mouser amid cat spat|work=ITV News|date=29 July 2016|access-date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladstone was taken to his new home at the Treasury in late June 2016, but the fallout from the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on European Union membership]] delayed the public announcement until late July.&lt;ref name="BF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashton|first1=Emily|title=Now The Treasury Has Got A Cat And He's Called Gladstone|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyashton/glad-to-meet-you|website=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File: Chancellor Javid and Gladstone.jpg|thumb|right|Former chancellor [[Sajid Javid]] and Gladstone (2019).]]
Gladstone was brought in by a staff member of [[Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home]] Lost and Found team in May 2016 as a neglected stray, after trying to get into his [[Cat-flap|cat flap]] for a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BIcuFWmgz-f// |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/BIcuFWmgz-f |archive-date=2021-12-26 |url-access=registration|title=Gladstone @treasury_cat Instagram Rescue Story|access-date=29 July 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been wandering the streets of London, hungry and without a [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchip]], so that his owners could not be located. At Battersea, he was known as Timmy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Joseph|title=Cat's out of the bag as Treasury reveals Whitehall arrival Gladstone|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/cat-s-out-of-the-bag-as-treasury-reveals-whitehall-arrival-gladstone-a3307456.html|website=Evening Standard|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many homeless cats without daily access to food and water, he would eat too much, too quickly. A special activity puzzle feeder remedied this issue.&lt;ref name="BF"/&gt;

'''India "Willie" Bush''' (July 13, 1990 – January 4, 2009) was a black [[ Shorthair cat]] owned by former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and [[First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]]. She lived with the [[Bush family]] for almost two decades.

==Biography==
The Bushes acquired India, an all-black, female [[American Shorthair]],&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news |title='First Feline' India dead at 18 |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2009/01/05/First_Feline_India_dead_at_18/UPI-86721231179731/ |work=[[United Press International]]|date=2009-01-05 |access-date=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in late 1991 or 1992 when their twin daughters [[Barbara Bush (born 1981)|Barbara]] and [[Jenna Bush Hager|Jenna Bush]] were nine years old. India remained with George and Laura Bush once their daughters left for college.&lt;ref name=hc&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Dunham|title=Dogs overshadow death of Bush family's cat |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6197327.html |work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=2009-01-06 |access-date=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cat moved with the Bushes to the [[White House]] from the [[Texas Governor's Mansion]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in early 2001 following Bush's inauguration as President.&lt;ref name=hc/&gt;

Despite living at the White House with the First Family, India had been largely overshadowed in the media by two of the Bushes' higher profile [[Scottish terrier]]s, [[Barney (dog)|Barney]] and [[Miss Beazley (dog)|Miss Beazley]]. However, she's seen in the "Barneycam" videos produced by the White House staff around Christmas time, her first being ''Where in the White House is Miss Beazley?'', where she was referred to as "Willie".&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; The dogs received significantly more media attention from the [[White House press corps]] during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush presidency]].&lt;ref name=hc/&gt;

The Bush family cat made an appearance in the March 2008 ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', as "Willie", in the [[East Sitting Hall]] of the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturaldigest.com/decor/2008-03/white_house_slideshow "At Home with History in the White House"], Architectural Digest,  March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

India died at the White House on January 4, 2009, at the age of 18.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark|last=Knoller|title=Death Of A White House Underdog: The Cat |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/01/05/couricandco/entry4700465.shtml |work=[[CBS News]]|date=2009-01-05 |access-date=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, Todd J., [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524133312/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/pets/stories/010608dnmetfirstpet.3e6aaec3.html Bush family cat dies at White House] [[Dallas Morning News]], 2009-01-05, retrieved 2009-01-05&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[press release|statement to the press]] regarding India's death, a spokesperson for First Lady observed that the family was "deeply saddened by their cat's death",&lt;ref name=upi /&gt; and went on to say "India was a beloved member of the Bush family for almost two decades. She will be greatly missed."&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

==Controversy in India==
There was some controversy reported in [[India]] as some people were upset with the cat's name. In July 2004, demonstrators in the southern Keralian city of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] denounced the cat's name as an insult to the nation of India, and burned an [[effigy]] of President Bush in protest.&lt;ref name=hc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bush's cat India provokes anger |date=3 July 2004 |newspaper=Deccan Herald |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Archives/july032004/n12.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130408/http://www.deccanherald.com/Archives/july032004/n12.asp |archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bushes did not change the cat's name in response to the demonstrations,&lt;ref name=hc/&gt; as their cat had been named after the baseball player [[Rubén Sierra]], who was nicknamed "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|El Indio]]" during his time with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] when Bush owned the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/kids/india/index.html |title=India's Official Biography |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2009-01-05 |access-date=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "India" had reportedly been given to the family cat by their daughter [[Barbara Bush (born 1981)|Barbara Bush]].&lt;ref name=hc/&gt;

He died in 2014 due to [[Lymphoma in animals|stomach lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Greenwood|first=Arin|date=2014-02-13|title=Goodbye To Hank, Beloved Cat Who Ran For U.S. Senate|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hank-the-cat-senate_n_4784836|access-date=2020-06-30|website=HuffPost|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
According to a satirical biography of Hank lampooning the rags-to-riches biographies prevalent for mainstream Senate candidates, Hank and his siblings were found on a street and taken to an animal shelter, and were initially designated for [[animal euthanasia]]. However, they were instead given to Animal Allies, a rescue group, and Hank was adopted by a family in [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]]. The biography then says Hank worked his way through school to gain high grades, and then entered into business, starting up several successful companies.&lt;ref name=AH&gt;{{cite web|title=About Hank|url=http://hankforsenate.com/AboutHank.aspx|publisher=Hank for Senate|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Run for Senate==
In his joke biography, Hank was encouraged to run because of his life story, experiences and his work ethic, while his website described him as "a refreshing candidate—energetic, inspiring, and real".&lt;ref name=AH /&gt; In reality, owners Matthew O'Leary and Anthony Roberts put him up when they both grew exasperated by regular political campaigns. Initially, Hank ran for state Senate, but gained only 9 write-in votes, though his owners mocked that by saying that regular politicians respond to such a defeat by running for the next highest office, which led to their decision to stand Hank for the United States Senate.&lt;ref name=APHP&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Arin|title=Hank The Cat, Running For Virginia Senate, Setting His Sights On 2016?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/26/hank-the-cat-senate-virginia-2016_n_1452934.html#slide=906062|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a joke candidacy, the campaign was built upon a couple of serious points—mocking conventional candidates, and to raise awareness and funds for animal groups, and rescue organizations donated $16,000 to the campaign. Hank's policies were described as "Animal Rescue, Spay &amp; Neuter programs, and Positive Campaign Reform."&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite news|title=Hank the cat third in senate race|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/full-coverage/us-election/a/-/article/15343002/hank-th-cat-third/|accessdate=11 November 2012|publisher=Yahoo!

Hank himself slept through the day.&lt;ref name=dcist&gt;{{cite news|last=Freed|first=Benjamin|title=Hank the Cat Claws His Way to Third Place in Virginia Senate Race|url=http://dcist.com/2012/11/hank_the_cat_claims_third_place_in.php|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=dcist|date=9 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824093910/http://dcist.com/2012/11/hank_the_cat_claims_third_place_in.php|archivedate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the election there were 7,319 write-in votes and Hank's owners stated that these all were votes for Hank, making him third.&lt;ref name=HP3rd&gt;{{cite news|title=Hank The Cat, Virginia Feline Running For U.S. Senate, Places 3rd|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/09/hank-cat-senate-third_n_2101887.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted media coverage not just in Virginia, but also nationally and internationally. By the end of the campaign, O'Leary and Roberts raised $60,000, which they intended to donate to animal charities, including one in Russia selected by Petrova in gratitude for her help.&lt;ref name=dcist /&gt;&lt;ref name=HP3rd /&gt; Roberts commended the effort, saying, "There are literally going to be lives that are saved with that. From our personal point of view we got to share our kitty with the entire world, and that's really great."&lt;ref name=dcist /&gt;

Hank's campaign was the subject of a parody [[attack ad]] launched on YouTube on March 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuttle|first=Hillary|title='Hank For Senate' Cat Campaign Dogged By Attack Ad (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/hank-for-senate-attack-ad-cat-senate-virginia_n_1316775.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nyan cat 250px frame.PNG|thumb|right|Nyan Cat]]
'''Nyan Cat''' is a [[YouTube]] video uploaded in April 2011, which became an [[internet meme]]. The video merged a [[Japanese pop]] song with an animated cartoon cat with a [[Pop-Tarts|Pop-Tart]] for a torso flying through space and leaving a [[rainbow]] trail behind. The video ranked at number five on the list of most viewed YouTube videos in 2011.&lt;ref name = "ranking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/12/talking-twin-babies-nyan-cat-and-friday-top-youtubes-most-watched-videos-of-2011.html|title=Talking Twin Babies, Nyan Cat among YouTube's top videos of 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 20, 2011|access-date=December 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605023312/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/12/talking-twin-babies-nyan-cat-and-friday-top-youtubes-most-watched-videos-of-2011.html|archive-date=2012-06-05|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

=== Animated GIF ===
[[File:Nyan cat doodle.PNG|thumb|right|Original Nyan Cat doodle]]
On April 2, 2011, the [[Animated GIF|GIF animation]] of the cat was posted by 25-year-old Christopher Torres of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], who uses the name "prguitarman", on his website ''LOL-Comics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prguitarman.com/index.php?id=348 |title=Pop Tart / Nyan Cat! |author=prguitarman |website=LOL-comics |date=April 2, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906230851/http://www.prguitarman.com/index.php?id=348 |archive-date=September 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Torres explained in an interview where the idea for the animation came from: "I was doing a donation drive for the [[Red Cross]] and in-between drawings in my [[Livestream]] video chat, two different people mentioned I should draw a 'Pop Tart' and a 'cat'." In response, he created a hybrid image of a [[Pop-Tarts|Pop-Tart]] and a cat, which was developed a few days later into the animated GIF.&lt;ref name="Pop" /&gt;
Nyan Cat was based on a real cat: Torres' pet cat Marty, who died in November 2012 from [[feline infectious peritonitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2012/11/02/rip-marty-nyan-cat/ |title=RIP Marty --The Inspiration for Nyan Cat |publisher=mashable.com |date=November 2, 2012 |access-date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://petslady.com/articles/meme_memory_rip_marty_nyan_cats_inspiration_59757 |title=From Meme To Memory: RIP Marty, Nyan Cat's Inspiration |publisher=petslady.com |date=November 2, 2012 |access-date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song ===
The original version of the song "Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!" was uploaded by user "daniwell"&lt;ref&gt;"daniwell" is variously credited on the web as daniwellP and Daniwell-P; the account that uploaded the song "Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!" uses the name daniwell.&lt;/ref&gt; to the Japanese video site [[Niconico]] on July 25, 2010.&lt;ref name="original"&gt;ニコニコ動画(原宿).【初音ミク】Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!【オリジナループ】.

Due to the video's popularity, many new [[remix]]es and cover versions have been made, some several hours long.

=== Website ===

Christopher Torres initially criticized the website www.nyan.cat, which originally featured a similar-looking cat with the pop tart replaced by a slice of toast,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110531001830/http://nyan.cat/ Non-Stop Nyan Cat!] The original nyan.cat, archived by the [[Wayback Machine]]. Retrieved 19 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same background music. The site, which uses the [[.cat]] [[sponsored top-level domain]], was described by Torres as "plagiarized".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyan.cat/ nyan.cat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531001830/http://nyan.cat/ |date=2011-05-31 }} Retrieved November 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prguitarman.tumblr.com/post/4954865409/huy-hong-so-tremendously-humbled-thank-you-lies |title=Huy Hong: so tremendously humbled, thank you.

== Temporary DMCA takedown ==

On June 27, 2011, the original YouTube video was taken down from the site following a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] complaint from someone claiming to be Torres. Torres immediately issued a statement on his website ''LOL-comics'' denying that he was the source of the complaint, and contacted Saraj00n and daniwell, who hold the copyright for the video and the song, in order to file a counter-complaint to YouTube. During the period that the video was unavailable for viewing, Torres received numerous abusive e-mails from people who wrongly believed that he had filed the DMCA complaint. On June 28, 2011, the Nyan Cat video was restored to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prguitarman.com/index.php?id=369 |title=I did NOT file a Youtube Copyright Complaint |publisher=prguitarman.com |date=June 27, 2011 |access-date=November 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726062134/http://www.prguitarman.com/index.php?id=369 |archive-date=July 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuit ==

In May 2013, Christopher Torres and Charles Schmidt, the creators of Nyan Cat and [[Keyboard Cat]] respectively, jointly sued [[5th Cell]] and [[Warner Bros.]] for [[copyright infringement]] and [[trademark infringement]] over the appearance of these characters without permission in the ''[[Scribblenauts (series)|Scribblenauts]]'' series of video games.

== Background ==
Tardar Sauce was one of a litter of four kittens born to a [[Calico cat|calico]] mother and a blue-and-white [[tabby]] putative father at the home of her owner, Tabatha Bundesen of [[Morristown, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="16facts" /&gt; The Bundesens said that Tardar Sauce's face appeared grumpy because the feline had a form of [[Dwarf cat|dwarfism]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Though the mother and father were described as "normal-sized [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-hair cats]]",&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grumpycats.com/about|title=About Grumpy Cat|website=grumpycats.com|access-date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tardar Sauce was undersized and had hind legs that are "a bit different".&lt;ref name="16facts" /&gt; Both she and her brother, Pokey, were born with "a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail".&lt;ref name="news.com.au" /&gt; Although she had a "grumpy" appearance and was called "Grumpy Cat", according to the Bundesens, "Ninety-nine percent of the time she is just a regular cat."&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

"Meme manager" Ben Lashes represented Grumpy Cat, in addition to [[Keyboard Cat]] and [[Nyan Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Rothman |first=Lily |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/04/18/internet-cats-behind-the-memes/ |title='Lil Bub &amp; Friendz': Internet Cats, Behind the Memes |magazine=Time |date=April 18, 2013 |access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Tabatha Bundesen took a [[leave of absence]] from her job at [[Red Lobster]] to manage Grumpy Cat's schedule, while her brother Bryan Bundesen manages the Grumpy Cat website, [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]] and [[Twitter]] accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jarvey|first=Natalie|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/7-figure-scowl-how-grumpy-721883|title=The 7-Figure Scowl: How Grumpy Cat Is Building a Media Empire|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 30, 2014|access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324412604578513352795950958|title=Grumpy Cat Has an Agent, and Now a Movie Deal|last=Rosman|first=Katherine|date=May 31, 2013|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=May 30, 2013|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tardar Sauce's handlers were interviewed by the respective hosts of each program. She was also featured in advertising campaigns for [[Friskies]] and [[General Mills|General Mills']] [[Honey Nut Cheerios]], and made public appearances to promote her own brand.

In December 2015, Grumpy Cat Limited filed a lawsuit against Grenade Beverage LLC citing [[trademark infringement]] when the beverage company expanded its line of Grumpy Cat coffee offerings beyond what was originally agreed upon, producing and marketing a Grumpy Cat roasted ground coffee even after being told by email that they were not approved to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/grumpy-cat-complaint/2720/|title=Grumpy Cat Complaint|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
